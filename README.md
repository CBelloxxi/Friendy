This is a brain child of mine for the last couple years. Le Wagon enabled me to bring this to a reality by giving me the skills to create this app. As such, I have pitched and lead this project in conjunction with three other fellow devs. 

The app allows you to contactlessly donate to the Homeless using uniquely generated QR codes, which links to the individual that is in need of help. From there, open banking makes transfers into the dedicated account which is accessible via verified stores for balances to be redeemed for items such as toiletries and hostels. 

I aim to make this app a reality and as such am in the process of trying to find a startup incubator and will continue to until there is an MVP ready for production.

The current app is a working prototype for visual demonstration and validation of the idea.
